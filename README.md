#Beautify :heart:

An iOS app written entirely in Swift, which let users design their own interface. 
So basically, what this app does is that it lets a user play with different color combinations by dynamically modifying RGB
values through a wheel. User can change the color of the font too, by triggering the switch to lock the background. 
In short, a user can make the interface of his own choice :yum:
